## What I learned from this project
Like my other project [Sketch](https://github.com/austintirrell/sketch), this was a rebuild of a project that previously took me a while to complete. It's just a bunch of if statements strung together to create the game, so rebuilding it was easy. Finding free to use transparent images that looked OK for the project, not so much. Trying to get the layout aesthetically pleasing was hard as well, and I'm still not super proud of the way it looks. However, it did the job and it was time for me to move onto another project that was more involved for me to continue learning.
